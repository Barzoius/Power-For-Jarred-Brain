  dialogues:
  - Hi, I'm Ozy.
  - "Ozy\u2014the ghoul, zombie even, living cadaver if you feel so inclined"
  - You want to pass through, am I right?
  - I see we are both armless.
  - Let me tell you what, you bring me my hands and I will open the gate for you.
  - What do you say?
  - Delightful, I lost it somewhere in the West.
  - Why are you still here, go on.
  - Ooh, so you came back.
  - Nice, I really missed these.
  - Come on, as promised I will roll up the gate.
